<h1>Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC|TC)</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=G2cG3mQqop'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=G2cG3mQqop</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Classical image clustering offers users no direct way to control the criterion that defines clusters.  Leveraging recent vision-language and large language models, the authors introduce a paradigm where users write a natural-language description of the desired criterion.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> IC|TC operates in three stages: (1) a vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) generates criterion-focused captions for each image; (2) a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) converts the captions into K cluster names through two sub-steps; (3) the LLM assigns every caption to one of those clusters.  Users can iteratively revise their text criterion.  Experiments compare IC|TC with deep clustering baselines on CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, Stanford-40, PPMI, FACET and a synthetic CIFAR-10-Gen set.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Across six datasets and a variety of criteria (object, action, location, mood, instrument, occupation), IC|TC attains higher clustering ACC/NMI/ARI than prior methods; e.g., 0.975 ACC on CIFAR-10 (vs. 0.636 for a caption-only baseline) and 0.774 ACC on Stanford-40 Action.  The method adapts to different numbers of clusters, remains strong on synthetic data (98.7 % ACC), and allows simple prompt edits to mitigate gender bias on FACET.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> IC|TC demonstrates that instruction-based clustering is practical and effective.  It yields interpretable cluster names, supports multiple criteria for one dataset, and invites future research on language-directed computer-vision tasks.</p></div>
