{"paper_title":"Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC|TC)","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=G2cG3mQqop","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Classical image clustering offers users no direct way to control the criterion that defines clusters.  Leveraging recent vision-language and large language models, the authors introduce a paradigm where users write a natural-language description of the desired criterion.","material_and_methods":"IC|TC operates in three stages: (1) a vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) generates criterion-focused captions for each image; (2) a large language model (e.g., GPT-4) converts the captions into K cluster names through two sub-steps; (3) the LLM assigns every caption to one of those clusters.  Users can iteratively revise their text criterion.  Experiments compare IC|TC with deep clustering baselines on CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, Stanford-40, PPMI, FACET and a synthetic CIFAR-10-Gen set.","results":"Across six datasets and a variety of criteria (object, action, location, mood, instrument, occupation), IC|TC attains higher clustering ACC/NMI/ARI than prior methods; e.g., 0.975 ACC on CIFAR-10 (vs. 0.636 for a caption-only baseline) and 0.774 ACC on Stanford-40 Action.  The method adapts to different numbers of clusters, remains strong on synthetic data (98.7 % ACC), and allows simple prompt edits to mitigate gender bias on FACET.","conclusion":"IC|TC demonstrates that instruction-based clustering is practical and effective.  It yields interpretable cluster names, supports multiple criteria for one dataset, and invites future research on language-directed computer-vision tasks."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
