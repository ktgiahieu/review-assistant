{"paper_title":"Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC|TC)","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=G2cG3mQqop","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Classical image-clustering techniques cannot be steered to match a user’s desired grouping principle. The authors propose a new paradigm in which the user supplies an arbitrary natural-language criterion to control the clustering outcome.","material_and_methods":"IC|TC uses a vision-language model (e.g., LLaVA) to caption each image according to the supplied text criterion, then a large language model (GPT-4 or variants) (i) proposes raw labels, (ii) merges them into K cluster names, and (iii) assigns every image to one of the clusters; the user may iteratively refine the criterion.","results":"Across six datasets (CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, Stanford-40, PPMI, and a synthetic CIFAR-10-Gen) IC|TC achieves 0.91–0.98 ACC on object-based clustering and consistently outperforms strong deep-clustering baselines such as SCAN. Experiments show controllability over different criteria (action, location, mood) and cluster granularities as well as a prompt-based fairness mitigation case study.","conclusion":"Leveraging instruction-tuned foundation models enables practical, controllable image clustering with minimal human effort; the framework opens avenues for language-directed computer-vision pipelines and highlights the importance of prompt engineering and fairness considerations."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
