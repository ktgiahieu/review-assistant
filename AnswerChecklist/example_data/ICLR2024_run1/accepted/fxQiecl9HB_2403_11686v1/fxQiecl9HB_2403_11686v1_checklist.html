<h1>Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Transformer encoders with fully–connected attention work well for molecules, but crystal structures are periodic and require handling infinite repetitions; existing methods either break periodicity or deviate from standard Transformers.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> The authors reinterpret fully connected attention under periodicity as a tractable ‘neural potential summation’, derive pseudo-finite periodic attention with Gaussian distance decay, and build Crystalformer— a normalization-free, 4-block Transformer that embeds periodic spatial and edge encodings. Training is performed on Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets using Adam with weight decay and stochastic weight averaging; no new data are collected and code is released.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Crystalformer uses only 29 % of Matformer’s parameters yet surpasses state-of-the-art GNN and Transformer baselines on nine crystal-property regression tasks, achieving lowest MAE on most targets; ablations confirm benefits of value position encoding and dense attention. Model inference is fastest among compared methods.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Neural potential summation enables a simple, efficient, fully connected Transformer for periodic structures that attains superior accuracy. Extensions to reciprocal-space attention for long-range interactions and incorporation of angular information are outlined as future work.</p></div>
