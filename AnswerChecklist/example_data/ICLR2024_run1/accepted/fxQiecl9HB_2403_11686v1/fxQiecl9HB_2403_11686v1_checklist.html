<h1>Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Crystal structures are infinite periodic arrangements of atoms; predicting their physical properties without expensive simulations is critical for accelerated material discovery. Transformer models have excelled on finite molecular graphs, but naively extending fully-connected attention to infinite periodic systems appears intractable.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> The authors reinterpret fully-connected attention under periodic boundary conditions as a tractable "neural potential summation" with Gaussian distance-decay.  They derive closed-form pseudo-finite periodic attention, introduce periodic spatial/edge encodings, and build Crystalformer—a normalization-free, four-block Transformer that pools atom states for property regression.  Training details and adaptive truncation for summations are provided; code is released.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> On nine regression tasks from the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets, Crystalformer achieves lower mean absolute errors than prior GNNs, Transformer variants, and physics-informed PotNet while using only 29 % of Matformer’s parameters and yielding fastest inference. Ablations show the necessity of value position encodings and efficacy of reciprocal-space extensions.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Crystalformer establishes an efficient, physically-motivated Transformer framework for periodic materials, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with fewer parameters and offering a unified view of infinite potential summations as attention.  Extensions to reciprocal space and higher-order/geometric information are discussed as future work.</p></div>
