{"paper_title":"Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Transformer encoders with fully–connected attention work well for molecules, but crystal structures are periodic and require handling infinite repetitions; existing methods either break periodicity or deviate from standard Transformers.","material_and_methods":"The authors reinterpret fully connected attention under periodicity as a tractable ‘neural potential summation’, derive pseudo-finite periodic attention with Gaussian distance decay, and build Crystalformer— a normalization-free, 4-block Transformer that embeds periodic spatial and edge encodings. Training is performed on Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets using Adam with weight decay and stochastic weight averaging; no new data are collected and code is released.","results":"Crystalformer uses only 29 % of Matformer’s parameters yet surpasses state-of-the-art GNN and Transformer baselines on nine crystal-property regression tasks, achieving lowest MAE on most targets; ablations confirm benefits of value position encoding and dense attention. Model inference is fastest among compared methods.","conclusion":"Neural potential summation enables a simple, efficient, fully connected Transformer for periodic structures that attains superior accuracy. Extensions to reciprocal-space attention for long-range interactions and incorporation of angular information are outlined as future work."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
