{"paper_title":"Crystalformer: Infinitely Connected Attention for Periodic Structure Encoding","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=fxQiecl9HB","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Crystal structures are infinite periodic arrangements of atoms; predicting their physical properties without expensive simulations is critical for accelerated material discovery. Transformer models have excelled on finite molecular graphs, but naively extending fully-connected attention to infinite periodic systems appears intractable.","material_and_methods":"The authors reinterpret fully-connected attention under periodic boundary conditions as a tractable \"neural potential summation\" with Gaussian distance-decay.  They derive closed-form pseudo-finite periodic attention, introduce periodic spatial/edge encodings, and build Crystalformer—a normalization-free, four-block Transformer that pools atom states for property regression.  Training details and adaptive truncation for summations are provided; code is released.","results":"On nine regression tasks from the Materials Project and JARVIS-DFT datasets, Crystalformer achieves lower mean absolute errors than prior GNNs, Transformer variants, and physics-informed PotNet while using only 29 % of Matformer’s parameters and yielding fastest inference. Ablations show the necessity of value position encodings and efficacy of reciprocal-space extensions.","conclusion":"Crystalformer establishes an efficient, physically-motivated Transformer framework for periodic materials, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines with fewer parameters and offering a unified view of infinite potential summations as attention.  Extensions to reciprocal space and higher-order/geometric information are discussed as future work."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
