{"paper_title":"Neural Active Learning Beyond Bandits","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Recent bandit-based neural active-learning methods provide theoretical guarantees but become inefficient as the number of classes K grows. This work asks how to retain principled exploration and guarantees while reducing the K-dependence.","material_and_methods":"The authors design two neural-network-based algorithms—NeurOnAl-S (stream-based) and NeurOnAl-P (pool-based)—that use separate exploitation and exploration networks fed with the original d-dimensional instance and an end-to-end embedding, respectively.  They extend the loss to any bounded loss, avoid the bandit arm transformation, derive regret bounds under NTK theory, and propose an inverse-gap sampling rule for the pool setting.","results":"Regret upper bounds grow only √K (instead of up to √(mdK)) and label complexity is reduced.  Experiments on six public datasets show consistent accuracy gains and large runtime savings versus bandit baselines; ablations and pool-based comparisons confirm the advantages.","conclusion":"By moving beyond the bandit reduction, the proposed methods mitigate the curse of classes, achieve tighter guarantees, and empirically outperform state-of-the-art active-learning baselines in both stream and pool scenarios."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
