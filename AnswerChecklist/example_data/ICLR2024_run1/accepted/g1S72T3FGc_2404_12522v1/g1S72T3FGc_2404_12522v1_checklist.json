{"paper_title":"Neural Active Learning Beyond Bandits","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Recent bandit-based neural active-learning methods suffer performance and computational penalties that scale with the number of classes K. The paper asks how to curb this dependence while keeping principled exploration and guarantees.","material_and_methods":"It proposes two algorithms (NeurONAl-S for stream-based, NeurONAl-P for pool-based) that use separate exploitation and exploration neural networks operating on the original d-dimensional input, introduce an end-to-end embedding for exploration, and a gap-inverse sampling rule for pools. Regret bounds are proved under NTK theory and low-noise or margin assumptions; empirical tests on six datasets compare accuracy and runtime.","results":"Theory shows regret and label-complexity growing more slowly in K than prior bandit approaches; in binary case dependence on effective dimension vanishes. Experiments show higher accuracy and much lower runtime than baselines across datasets, especially for large K.","conclusion":"Redesigning the model interface and exploration strategy removes the curse of K, yields tighter guarantees and faster, more accurate active learning in both stream and pool settings."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
