<h1>Neural Active Learning Beyond Bandits</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Recent bandit-based neural active-learning methods provide theoretical guarantees but become inefficient as the number of classes K grows. This work asks how to retain principled exploration and guarantees while reducing the K-dependence.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> The authors design two neural-network-based algorithms—NeurOnAl-S (stream-based) and NeurOnAl-P (pool-based)—that use separate exploitation and exploration networks fed with the original d-dimensional instance and an end-to-end embedding, respectively.  They extend the loss to any bounded loss, avoid the bandit arm transformation, derive regret bounds under NTK theory, and propose an inverse-gap sampling rule for the pool setting.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Regret upper bounds grow only √K (instead of up to √(mdK)) and label complexity is reduced.  Experiments on six public datasets show consistent accuracy gains and large runtime savings versus bandit baselines; ablations and pool-based comparisons confirm the advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> By moving beyond the bandit reduction, the proposed methods mitigate the curse of classes, achieve tighter guarantees, and empirically outperform state-of-the-art active-learning baselines in both stream and pool scenarios.</p></div>
