<h1>Neural Active Learning Beyond Bandits</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=g1S72T3FGc</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Recent bandit-based neural active-learning methods suffer performance and computational penalties that scale with the number of classes K. The paper asks how to curb this dependence while keeping principled exploration and guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> It proposes two algorithms (NeurONAl-S for stream-based, NeurONAl-P for pool-based) that use separate exploitation and exploration neural networks operating on the original d-dimensional input, introduce an end-to-end embedding for exploration, and a gap-inverse sampling rule for pools. Regret bounds are proved under NTK theory and low-noise or margin assumptions; empirical tests on six datasets compare accuracy and runtime.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> Theory shows regret and label-complexity growing more slowly in K than prior bandit approaches; in binary case dependence on effective dimension vanishes. Experiments show higher accuracy and much lower runtime than baselines across datasets, especially for large K.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Redesigning the model interface and exploration strategy removes the curse of K, yields tighter guarantees and faster, more accurate active learning in both stream and pool settings.</p></div>
