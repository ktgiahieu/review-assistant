<h1>CRAFT: Customizing LLMs by Creating and Retrieving from Specialized Toolsets</h1>
<p><strong>Paper Link:</strong> <a href='https://openreview.net/forum?id=G0vdDSt9XM'>https://openreview.net/forum?id=G0vdDSt9XM</a></p>
<h2>Formatted Abstract</h2>
<div class='abstract-section'><p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Existing approaches augmenting large language models (LLMs) with tools rely on general-purpose APIs and cannot be easily adapted to new domains. The authors aim to design a flexible, training-free framework that generates tailored toolsets and equips LLMs to retrieve and invoke them.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> CRAFT first samples task-specific problems, prompts GPT-4 to generate executable code solutions, abstracts them into reusable tools, verifies correctness, and deduplicates. At inference, a multi-view retrieval mechanism matches the target query with tool metadata (source question, function name, docstring) and appends the retrieved snippets to the LLM prompt for execution.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> On visual question answering, tabular processing and mathematical reasoning, CRAFT with GPT-3.5-Turbo outperforms strong baselines, e.g., achieving 43 %â€“48 % relative F1 improvement on vision-language datasets and +17 % absolute accuracy on the MATH algebra subset. Ablations show gains from abstraction and multi-view retrieval; performance scales with both toolset size and backbone capability.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> CRAFT provides a broadly applicable, plug-and-play methodology for task adaptation without fine-tuning. The released, low-complexity toolsets and analysis suggest that creating and reusing specialized tools can systematically enhance LLM problem-solving across domains.</p></div>
