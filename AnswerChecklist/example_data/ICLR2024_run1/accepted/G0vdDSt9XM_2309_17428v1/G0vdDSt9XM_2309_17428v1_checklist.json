{"paper_title":"CRAFT: Customizing LLMs by Creating and Retrieving from Specialized Toolsets","paper_link":"https://openreview.net/forum?id=G0vdDSt9XM","formatted_abstract":{"background_and_objectives":"Existing approaches augmenting large language models (LLMs) with tools rely on general-purpose APIs and cannot be easily adapted to new domains. The authors aim to design a flexible, training-free framework that generates tailored toolsets and equips LLMs to retrieve and invoke them.","material_and_methods":"CRAFT first samples task-specific problems, prompts GPT-4 to generate executable code solutions, abstracts them into reusable tools, verifies correctness, and deduplicates. At inference, a multi-view retrieval mechanism matches the target query with tool metadata (source question, function name, docstring) and appends the retrieved snippets to the LLM prompt for execution.","results":"On visual question answering, tabular processing and mathematical reasoning, CRAFT with GPT-3.5-Turbo outperforms strong baselines, e.g., achieving 43 %–48 % relative F1 improvement on vision-language datasets and +17 % absolute accuracy on the MATH algebra subset. Ablations show gains from abstraction and multi-view retrieval; performance scales with both toolset size and backbone capability.","conclusion":"CRAFT provides a broadly applicable, plug-and-play methodology for task adaptation without fine-tuning. The released, low-complexity toolsets and analysis suggest that creating and reusing specialized tools can systematically enhance LLM problem-solving across domains."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
