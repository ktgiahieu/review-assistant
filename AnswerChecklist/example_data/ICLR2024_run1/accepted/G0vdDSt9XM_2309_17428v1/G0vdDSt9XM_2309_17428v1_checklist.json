The authors aim to enable flexible task-specific augmentation.","material_and_methods":"They propose CRAFT, a framework that automatically creates a toolset from training or instruction data by prompting GPT-4 to generate, abstract, verify and deduplicate code snippets, and retrieves relevant tools at inference with a multi-view similarity scheme.","results":"On vision-language, tabular and math reasoning benchmarks, CRAFT with GPT-3.5-Turbo yields up to 45.4 % soft-accuracy on GQA and large gains over baselines; ablations show each component and larger toolsets/backbones further improve performance.","conclusion":"CRAFT offers a training-free, plug-and-play way to specialize LLMs, releasing validated, reusable tools and demonstrating scalability, reliability and extensibility."},"checklists":[{"section_title":"A.
