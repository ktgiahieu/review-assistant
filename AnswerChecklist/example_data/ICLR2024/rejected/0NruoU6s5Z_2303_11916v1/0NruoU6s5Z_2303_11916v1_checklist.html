Formatted Abstract
</h1>
<p><strong>Background and Objectives:</strong> Composed image retrieval (CIR) combines a reference image and a modification instruction to retrieve a target image that satisfies the instruction. Existing CIR methods suffer from limited training data and support only simple text conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Material and Methods:</strong> We synthesize a large-scale dataset (SynthTriplets18M) of 18.8 M triplets ⟨reference image, condition, target image⟩ via keyword-based and LLM-based caption editing, followed by text-to-image generation with multiple Stable Diffusion variants and filtering. We propose CompoDiff, a latent diffusion model in CLIP embedding space that translates a noised reference image embedding to a target embedding under text, image, and mask conditions via classifier-free guidance. Two-stage training leverages LAION-2B for text-to-image pretraining and multi-task fine-tuning with SynthTriplets18M, inpainting, and retrieval.</p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong> CompoDiff achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot CIR on FashionIQ (Avg. R@10 42.33) and CIRR (Avg. R@1 22.88), outperforms prior methods on domain conversion, and supports versatile queries with negative and mask conditions. Fine-tuning CLIP4Cir on SynthTriplets18M yields new supervised SOTA. Ablations demonstrate the impact of dataset scale, text encoder choice, inference steps, and guidance weights.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> SynthTriplets18M and CompoDiff substantially advance generalizable CIR by enabling complex composed queries and high zero-shot performance. Our dataset, code, and pretrained models are released to foster future research.</p>
