**Paper Title:** MIM4DD: Mutual Information Maximization for Dataset Distillation
**Overall Recommendation:** [Accept/Reject/Borderline] (To be determined after completing the review)

**1. Significance and novelty**

*   The paper tackles an important problem in machine learning: dataset distillation. Reducing the reliance on large datasets is crucial for efficient training and deployment of deep learning models.
*   The approach of framing dataset distillation as a mutual information maximization problem is novel and theoretically well-motivated. Using mutual information to guide the distillation process offers a principled alternative to existing heuristic methods.
*   The proposed MIM4DD framework, leveraging contrastive learning to optimize a lower bound on mutual information, is a practical and effective way to implement the information-theoretic perspective.
*   The plug-and-play nature of MIM4DD, enabling it to enhance existing dataset distillation pipelines, increases its practical significance.
*   The experimental results demonstrate clear improvements over state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

**2. Potential reasons for acceptance**

*   **Strong theoretical grounding:** The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for its approach, casting dataset distillation within the framework of mutual information maximization. The derivation of the contrastive learning objective as a lower bound on mutual information is well-explained.
*   **Novelty:** The paper introduces a fresh perspective on dataset distillation by focusing on the information-theoretic aspects of the problem. This approach differs significantly from existing methods that rely on gradient matching or trajectory alignment.
*   **Empirical Validation:** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MIM4DD through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.
*   **Practicality:** The "plug-and-play" nature of MIM4DD makes it easy to integrate into existing dataset distillation pipelines, increasing its potential impact.
*   **Clarity and Readability:** The paper is generally well-written and easy to understand, with clear explanations of the proposed method and its theoretical underpinnings.

**3. Potential reasons for rejection**

*   **Reason 1: Limited ablation studies**
    *   The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the contribution of each component of the MIM4DD framework. More specifically, there is a hyperparameter **beta** that controls the layer weighting in equation 3.5 that can be more rigorously tested.
    *   While the ablation study on λ is helpful, it does not fully explore the impact of different network architectures for the embedding functions $`g_{\phi}`$ and $`d(\cdot, \cdot)`$, or the choice of temperature τ.
*   **Reason 2: Justification of "In-variance of Mutual Information" in Theorem 1.**
    *   The authors leverage the "In-variance of Mutual Information" (Theorem 1) to state that the output feature maps from each layer should share the same information as the original data. However, this "In-variance of Mutual Information" property is only satisfied when the transformation is a *homeomorphism*. It is unclear that the activation function *sigmoid*, is homeomorphisms?
    *   It is unclear why maximizing the lower bound MI is equivalent to maximizing MI in general. The loss function may not guarantee to find the global optimum. 
*   **Reason 3: Limited discussion of computational complexity**
    *   The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of MIM4DD, especially in comparison to other dataset distillation methods. 
    *   The contrastive learning framework introduces additional overhead for computing embeddings and similarity scores, which could be significant for large datasets or complex network architectures. There is a need to address the scalability concerns of MIM4DD.
*   **Reason 4: Sensitivity to hyperparameters**
    *   Contrastive learning is known to be sensitive to hyperparameter tuning, and the paper does not adequately address this issue. The paper uses a CNN with 128 filters, which is not rigorous enough.
    *   The performance of MIM4DD may vary significantly depending on the choice of learning rate, batch size, temperature parameter τ, and the architecture of the embedding functions.
    *   Lack of explanation on how these hyperparameters were tuned, especially since the authors were comparing to prior work.

**4. Suggestions for improvement**

*   **Suggestion 1: Conduct more extensive ablation studies.** Investigate the impact of different network architectures for the embedding functions $`g_{\phi}`$ and $`d(\cdot, \cdot)`$, as well as the choice of temperature τ. Further, more rigourously test the impact of hyperparameter **beta**, that controls the layer weighting in equation 3.5.
*   **Suggestion 2: Justification of "In-variance of Mutual Information" in Theorem 1.** Rigorously discuss that the "In-variance of Mutual Information" (Theorem 1) is only satisfied when the transformation is a *homeomorphism*. Is the activation function *sigmoid* is a homeomorphisms? Also, it is unclear why maximizing the lower bound MI is equivalent to maximizing MI in general.
*   **Suggestion 3: Provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of MIM4DD** in comparison to other dataset distillation methods, and discuss potential strategies for reducing the computational overhead.
*   **Suggestion 4: Conduct experiments to assess the sensitivity of MIM4DD to hyperparameter tuning,** and provide guidelines for selecting appropriate hyperparameter values. Additionally, a discussion on how these hyperparameters are tuned would be greatly appreciated.
