Review outline:

**Overall Assessment:** This paper presents a compelling and well-supported argument that challenges conventional wisdom in graph contrastive learning (GCL). The findings regarding the dispensability of positive pairs, negative pairs, and complex augmentations are surprising and potentially impactful. The paper provides theoretical justification for these observations by highlighting the implicit regularization effects of GNN architectures. While the paper is strong, there are some areas where further clarification and analysis could strengthen the claims.

**1. Significance and novelty**

*   The paper tackles a fundamental and underexplored question in GCL: why does it work? This is more significant than incremental improvements on existing methods.
*   The counter-intuitive findings (positive-free, negative-free, augmentation-robustness) are genuinely novel and challenge established practices in both GCL and visual contrastive learning (VCL).
*   The architectural perspective, focusing on the implicit biases of GNNs, is a fresh and potentially unifying approach to understanding self-supervised learning on graphs.
*   The theoretical analyses, while focused on specific GNN components, provide valuable insights and establish a foundation for more rigorous understanding.

**2. Potential reasons for acceptance**

*   **Strong Empirical Validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and GCL methods, providing strong evidence for the key claims.
*   **Theoretical Justification:** The theoretical analyses, while simplified, offer plausible explanations for the observed phenomena and connect the empirical results to architectural properties.
*   **Clarity and Writing Quality:** The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and clearly articulates the motivation, findings, and implications of the work.
*   **Open Source Code:** The availability of the code allows for reproducibility and further exploration of the proposed ideas.
*   **Challenging existing dogmas:** The paper is bold and directly contradicts common assumptions. This is good.
**3. Potential reasons for rejection**

*   **Limited Scope of Theoretical Analysis:**
    *   The theoretical analysis focuses primarily on vanilla GCN and ContraNorm. It is not clear how these results generalize to other GNN architectures (e.g., GAT, GraphSAGE) or more complex GCL methods.
    *   The theorems provide insights but may not fully capture the complex interactions within the GCL framework. The assumptions made in the theorems may limit their applicability to real-world scenarios. Further discussion regarding the limitation of these theorems is necessary.
*   **Lack of Ablation Studies on Specific GNN Components:**
    *   While the paper compares GCN and MLP encoders, it does not perform more granular ablation studies on specific components within the GNN architecture (e.g., different aggregation functions, normalization layers).
    *   It is unclear whether the observed effects are solely due to the message-passing mechanism or whether other factors, such as the choice of activation function or the depth of the network, also play a significant role.
*   **Missing Comparisons with Recent Negative-Free/Positive-Free Methods:**
    *   While the paper mentions related work on negative-free contrastive learning, it does not provide a detailed comparison with recent methods that explicitly address the problem of collapse in the absence of negatives.
    *   Similarly, it is important to compare the proposed approach with existing methods that aim to reduce the reliance on hand-crafted augmentations in GCL. Directly comparing the performance with the performance of these methods will highlight the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.
*   **Overstatement of Claims and Scope:**
    *   The paper sometimes overstates the generality of its findings, implying that positive pairs, negative pairs and complex augmentations are *never* necessary for GCL. This should be softened.
    *   The "first decisive step" and "no prior work" claims in the abstract and introduction are strong and may be perceived as dismissive of previous research. These claims should be justified more thoroughly or toned down.
    *   The paper only covers the case when *both* positive/negative examples are entirely excluded from the training process, but there are many intermediate settings in which the performance of existing GCL algorithms could vary dramatically across different hyper-parameter values.

**4. Suggestions for improvement**

*   **Broaden the Theoretical Analysis:** Extend the theoretical analysis to cover a wider range of GNN architectures and GCL methods. Explore how the implicit regularization effects of different GNN components contribute to the observed phenomena.
*   **Conduct More Granular Ablation Studies:** Perform ablation studies on specific components within the GNN architecture to isolate the factors that contribute to the positive-free, negative-free, and augmentation-robustness properties.
*   **Provide a More Comprehensive Comparison with Related Work:** Include a detailed comparison with recent methods that address the problem of collapse in negative-free contrastive learning and that aim to reduce the reliance on hand-crafted augmentations in GCL.
*   **Discuss Limitations and Future Directions:** Acknowledge the limitations of the current analysis and suggest directions for future research. For example, discuss how the findings might be extended to other self-supervised graph paradigms or to different types of graph data. Consider discussing the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of hyper-parameters. For example, is the ContraNorm method robust with respect to the choice of alpha?
