  "full_review": "**Summary:**\nThis paper introduces Binary Radiance Fields (BiRF), a novel approach to neural radiance fields that focuses on reducing storage requirements through the use of binary feature encoding. BiRF represents local features using binary parameters (+1 or -1) within a 2D-3D hybrid feature grid. The method employs a binarization-aware training scheme and demonstrates competitive reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art efficient radiance field models, while using significantly less storage space. The authors claim superior performance in static scene reconstruction, achieving high PSNR scores on standard datasets with only 0.5 MB of storage.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThe primary strength of this paper lies in its significant reduction of storage requirements for radiance field representations. The use of binary feature encoding is a novel approach that allows for a dramatic decrease in model size. The 2D-3D hybrid feature grid is also a well-motivated design choice, leveraging the strengths of both 2D planes and 3D voxels. The experimental results demonstrate that BiRF can achieve competitive reconstruction quality compared to other methods while using orders of magnitude less storage.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nThe paper's analysis of BiRF's limitations, particularly concerning scene complexity and challenging lighting conditions, is insufficient. The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between scene complexity and performance metrics. There is no evidence presented to suggest that BiRF's performance significantly drops under specific lighting conditions such as extreme shadows or specular reflections. The paper inadequately addresses potential failure cases and artifact generation in BiRF. While it acknowledges a trade-off between storage and quality, it lacks a thorough analysis of the limitations of binary encoding and fails to provide failure case analyses demonstrating scenarios where BiRF produces noticeable artifacts. The paper does not offer quantitative analysis focusing on high-frequency details or assess the perceptual impact of binarization on complex textures. The paper also lacks a discussion on the impact of noisy or incomplete input data on BiRF's performance. The paper does not adequately address the potential for information loss due to binarization. The paper lacks a direct quantification of information loss during binarization, either theoretically or empirically.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. How does the performance of BiRF degrade with increasing scene complexity, and what specific aspects of the binary encoding contribute to these limitations?\n2. Are there potential failure cases or scenarios where BiRF might produce artifacts or inaccurate reconstructions, and what measures have been taken to address these issues?\n3. How does the choice of binarization strategy affect the expressiveness and generalization ability of the radiance field representation, and are there alternative binarization techniques that could potentially improve performance?\n4. Does the paper adequately address the potential for information loss due to binarization, and are there any strategies employed to mitigate this loss and maintain reconstruction quality?\n5. The paper mentions longer training times compared to un-binarized counterparts. Can the authors provide a more detailed computational analysis of the 2D-3D hybrid feature grid, including FLOPs, memory access, and scaling behavior with scene complexity?\n6. The paper demonstrates sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, particularly regarding the hash table size. Are there adaptive strategies for dynamically adjusting the sparsity loss to ensure robust performance across different datasets?\n\n**Soundness:**\n3\n\n**Presentation:**\n3\n\n**Contribution:**\n3\n\n**Rating:**\n6\n\n**Confidence:**\n4",

    "The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of BiRF's performance under challenging scene characteristics, such as highly specular or reflective surfaces, complex occlusions, and varying lighting conditions. The absence of experimental results and discussion on these aspects raises concerns about its robustness in diverse environments.",
    "The paper acknowledges longer training times compared to un-binarized methods but lacks a detailed computational analysis of the 2D-3D hybrid feature grid, including FLOPs, memory access, and scaling behavior with scene complexity. This omission makes it difficult to assess the practical efficiency gains of the proposed method.",
    "The paper demonstrates sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, particularly regarding the hash table size, and lacks adaptive strategies for dynamically adjusting the sparsity loss to ensure robust performance across different datasets. This suggests a need for more automated or robust hyperparameter selection methods.",
    "The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between scene complexity and performance metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. It reports PSNR values for different datasets but fails to categorize scenes by geometric complexity or analyze how this impacts the metrics.",
    "There is no evidence presented to suggest that BiRF's performance significantly drops under specific lighting conditions such as extreme shadows or specular reflections. The paper's 'Qualitative Results' section does not discuss or visually demonstrate performance under such conditions, and the 'Quantitative Results' section does not include a breakdown of performance based on specific lighting conditions.",
    "The paper inadequately addresses potential failure cases and artifact generation in BiRF. While it acknowledges a trade-off between storage and quality, it lacks a thorough analysis of the limitations of binary encoding and fails to provide failure case analyses demonstrating scenarios where BiRF produces noticeable artifacts.",
    "The paper does not offer quantitative analysis (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS) focusing on high-frequency details or assess the perceptual impact of binarization on complex textures. This limits the understanding of how binarization affects the visual quality of the reconstructed scenes.",
    "The paper omits discussion of specific hyperparameter settings that could lead to instability or artifact generation. This lack of guidance makes it difficult to reproduce the results or apply the method effectively in new scenarios.",
    "Critically, the paper fails to address the potential for aliasing artifacts due to the discrete nature of the binary encoding. This is a significant concern that could impact the visual quality of the reconstructions.",
    "The paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of the impact of binarization on expressiveness and generalization. Specifically, the paper does not quantify the information loss due to binarization nor does it analyze the sensitivity of the BiRF model to different binarization thresholds.",
    "The paper does not provide a theoretical lower bound on the information loss introduced by the binarization process and does not directly compare BiRF's performance against radiance fields employing ternary or adaptive quantization strategies. This limits the understanding of the optimality of the chosen binarization approach.",
    "The paper does not adequately address the potential for information loss due to binarization. The paper lacks a direct quantification of information loss during binarization, either theoretically or empirically.",
    "The reconstruction loss, an L2 norm, is not explicitly linked to the degree of binarization, and there is no analysis of how these losses affect different scene complexities. This makes it difficult to understand how the loss function is guiding the binarization process.",
    "While the paper acknowledges some limitations of binarization, it does not comprehensively address the potential for artifacts or blurring, especially in high-frequency regions. This is a critical omission that needs to be addressed with more detailed analysis and potentially mitigation strategies."
