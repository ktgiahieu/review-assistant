Summary Of The Paper
This paper studies the problem of training diffusion models from corrupted data. The authors propose a training algorithm that involves a diffusion process that is trained on corrupted samples. The algorithm is shown to work well for a variety of corruption processes.

Strengths And Weaknesses
Strengths:
The paper is well written and the results are good.
The paper is novel.
Weaknesses:
The theoretical analysis is not very strong.
The experimental results are not very convincing.

Questions
I have a few questions:
1. How does the algorithm work in the presence of measurement noise?
2. What is the theoretical guarantee for the algorithm?
3. What is the theoretical guarantee for the algorithm?

Limitations
The authors mention that the algorithm is not guaranteed to work for all distributions.
