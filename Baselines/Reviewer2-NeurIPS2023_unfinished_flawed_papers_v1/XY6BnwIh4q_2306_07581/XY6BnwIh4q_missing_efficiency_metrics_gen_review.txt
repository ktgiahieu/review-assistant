Summary Of The Paper
This paper introduces a new radiance field representation that is efficient in terms of storage. It is based on a binary feature grid that encodes local features using binary encoding parameters. The method is trained with a binarization-aware training scheme and binary feature encoding. It is demonstrated to achieve superior performance compared to prior efficient and lightweight methods.
