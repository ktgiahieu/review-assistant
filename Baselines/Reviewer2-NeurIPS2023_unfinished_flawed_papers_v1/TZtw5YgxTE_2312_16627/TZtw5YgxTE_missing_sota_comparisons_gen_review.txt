Summary Of The Paper
This paper introduces a new framework for dataset distillation, which is to maximize the mutual information between the real and synthetic data. The proposed method can be seen as a contrastive learning framework. The authors provide a theoretical formulation and an implementation method. The experiments show that the proposed method can outperform the existing methods.
