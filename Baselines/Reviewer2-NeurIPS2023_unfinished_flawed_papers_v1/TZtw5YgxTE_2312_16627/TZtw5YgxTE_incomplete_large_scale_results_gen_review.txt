Summary Of The Paper
This paper introduces a new method for dataset distillation, Mutual Information Maximization for Dataset Distillation (MIM4DD). The method is based on the idea of maximizing the mutual information between the real and synthetic data. The authors show that by maximizing the mutual information, the heterogeneity in the generated images can be enhanced, which further improves the performance of the DD method. The authors also show that their method can be implemented as an add-on module for existing SoTA DD methods.
