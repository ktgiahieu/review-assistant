However, the reasoning is not entirely correct according to the ground truth. The ground truth states that the *authors* claim the algorithm *does not* require fore-knowledge of the stream length and that the manuscript's 'ambiguous treatment' is the gap. The review, conversely, states the paper *assumes* the length is known or bounded, framing it as a limitation ('which may not always be the case in practice'). This misinterprets the core issue as presented in the ground truth, which is about the *clarity* of the assumption (or lack thereof) and the authors' commitment to address it, rather than the assumption itself being definitively present and problematic in the way the review describes."
