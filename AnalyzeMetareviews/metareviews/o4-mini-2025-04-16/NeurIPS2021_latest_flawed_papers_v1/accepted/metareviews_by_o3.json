However, the ground-truth flaw is that the paper does not clearly specify a threat model at all—i.e., it omits what the attacker, clients, and server know or can do—making it impossible to judge the defense. The generated review instead argues that the threat model is *too narrow* (only targeted poisoning, no adaptive/backdoor attacks) but implicitly assumes that some threat model is already provided. It does not criticize the absence of a precise specification of roles, knowledge, or capabilities, nor does it explain why such a specification is foundational for evaluating the defense. Therefore, while the flaw is identified in name, the reasoning does not align with the ground truth."
