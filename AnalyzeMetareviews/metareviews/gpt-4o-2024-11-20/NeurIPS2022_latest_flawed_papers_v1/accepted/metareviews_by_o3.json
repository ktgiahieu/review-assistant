This aligns with the ground-truth concern that improvements may simply reflect optimisation toward brittle metrics rather than genuine quality gains, and that a human study is needed to validate results. While the reviewer does not use the exact term \"over-fitting,\" the articulated worry that overlap metrics fail to measure true quality, and the call for human evaluation, match the essence of the planted flaw."
