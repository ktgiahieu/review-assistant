The review therefore touches on the surface symptom (insufficient in-paper detail) but fails to reason about the substantive missing specifications emphasised in the ground truth."

The reviewer instead (i) explicitly praises the paper for \"tight theory\" and claims the bounds match the lower bounds, (ii) only questions a different form of gap (Ω(C) vs √T) for the weak adversary, and (iii) does not mention the unknown-budget scenario or the strong-adversary mismatch at all.
