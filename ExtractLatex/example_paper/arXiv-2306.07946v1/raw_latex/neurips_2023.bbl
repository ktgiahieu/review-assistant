Accurately predicting user preference and making a recommendation of favorable items plays a crucial role in improving several key tasks such as Click Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) in order to increase commercial value. Some state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods exploiting non-linear interactions on a user-item bipartite graph are able to learn better user and item representations with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which do not learn hierarchical representations of graphs because they are inherently flat. Hierarchical representation is reportedly favorable in making more personalized item recommendations in terms of behaviorally similar users in the same community and a context of topic-driven taxonomy. However, some advanced approaches, in this regard, are either only considering linear interactions, or adopting single-level community, or computationally expensive. To address these problems, we propose a novel method with Hierarchical bipartite Graph Neural Network (HiGNN) to handle large-scale e-commerce tasks. By stacking multiple GNN modules and using a deterministic clustering algorithm alternately, HiGNN is able to efficiently obtain hierarchical user and item embeddings simultaneously, and effectively predict user preferences on a larger scale. Extensive experiments on some real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate that HiGNN achieves a significant improvement compared to several popular methods. Moreover, we deploy HiGNN in Taobao, one of the largest e-commerces with hundreds of million users and items, for a series of large-scale prediction tasks of item recommendations. The results also illustrate that HiGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications. \newblock (@Li2020HierarchicalBG)

Traditional auction mechanisms, such as GSP and VCG auctions, can be suboptimal due to their fixed allocation rules to optimize a single performance metric (e.g., revenue or social welfare). Recently, data-driven auctions, learned directly from auction outcomes to optimize multiple performance metrics, have attracted increasing research interests. However, the procedure of auction mechanisms involves various discrete calculation operations, making it challenging to be compatible with continuous optimization pipelines in machine learning. In this paper, we design Deep Neural Auctions (DNAs) to enable end-to-end auction learning by proposing a differentiable model to relax the discrete sorting operation, a key component in auctions. We optimize the performance metrics by developing deep models to efficiently extract contexts from auctions, providing rich features for auction design. We further integrate the game theoretical conditions within the model design, to guarantee the stability of the auctions. DNAs have been successfully deployed in the e-commerce advertising system at Taobao. Experimental evaluation results on both large-scale data set as well as online A/B test demonstrated that DNAs significantly outperformed other mechanisms widely adopted in industry. \newblock (@liu2021neural)

Today’s recommender systems suggest items of various media types, including audio, text, visual (images), and videos. In fact, scientific research related to the analysis of multimedia content has made possible effective content-based recommender systems capable of suggesting items based on an analysis of the features extracted from the item itself. The aim of this survey is to present a thorough review of the state-of-the-art of recommender systems that leverage multimedia content, by classifying the reviewed papers with respect to their media type, the techniques employed to extract and represent their content features, and the recommendation algorithm. Moreover, for each media type, we discuss various domains in which multimedia content plays a key role in human decision-making and is therefore considered in the recommendation process. Examples of the identified domains include fashion, tourism, food, media streaming, and e-commerce. \newblock (@Deldjoo2020)

Commonly, ERSs operate as a "black box" and give students no insight into the rationale of their choice. Recent contributions from the learning analytics and educational data mining communities have emphasised the importance of transparent, understandable and open learner models (OLMs) that provide insight and enhance learners' understanding of interactions with learning environments. In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of complementing ERSs with transparent and understandable OLMs that provide justification for their recommendations. We conduct a randomised control trial experiment using an ERS with two interfaces ("Non-Complemented Interface" and "Complemented Interface") to determine the effect of our approach on student engagement and their perception of the effectiveness of the ERS. Overall, our results suggest that complementing an ERS with an OLM can have a positive effect on student engagement and their perception about the effectiveness of the system despite potentially making the system harder to navigate. In some cases, complementing an ERS with an OLM has the negative consequence of decreasing engagement, understandability and sense of fairness. \newblock (@abdi2020complementing)

Based on this review, we need research on learning analytics reporting systems that targets the design and development process of reporting systems, not only the final products. This design and development process includes needs analyses, visual design analyses, information selection justifications, and student perception surveys. In addition, experiments to determine the effect of these systems on student behavior, achievement, and skills are needed to add to the small existing body of evidence. Furthermore, experimental studies should include usability tests and methodologies to examine student use of these systems, as these factors may affect experimental findings. Finally, observational study methods, such as propensity score matching, should be used to increase student access to these systems but still rigorously measure experimental effects. \newblock (@bodily2017review)

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area. \newblock (@su2009survey)

Academic research in the field is historically often based on the matrix completion problem formulation, where for each user-item-pair only one interaction (e.g., a rating) is considered. In many application domains, however, multiple user-item interactions of different types can be recorded over time. And, a number of recent works have shown that this information can be used to build richer individual user models and to discover additional behavioral patterns that can be leveraged in the recommendation process. In this work, we review existing works that consider information from such sequentially ordered user-item interaction logs in the recommendation process. Based on this review, we propose a categorization of the corresponding recommendation tasks and goals, summarize existing algorithmic solutions, discuss methodological approaches when benchmarking what we call sequence-aware recommender systems , and outline open challenges in the area. \newblock (@quadrana2018sequence)

In recent years, session-based recommender systems (SBRSs) have emerged as a new paradigm of RSs. Different from other RSs such as content-based RSs and collaborative filtering-based RSs that usually model long-term yet static user preferences, SBRSs aim to capture short-term but dynamic user preferences to provide more timely and accurate recommendations sensitive to the evolution of their session contexts. Although SBRSs have been intensively studied, neither unified problem statements for SBRSs nor in-depth elaboration of SBRS characteristics and challenges are available. It is also unclear to what extent SBRS challenges have been addressed and what the overall research landscape of SBRSs is. This comprehensive review of SBRSs addresses the above aspects by exploring in depth the SBRS entities (e.g., sessions), behaviours (e.g., users’ clicks on items), and their properties (e.g., session length). We propose a general problem statement of SBRSs, summarize the diversified data characteristics and challenges of SBRSs, and define a taxonomy to categorize the representative SBRS research. Finally, we discuss new research opportunities in this exciting and vibrant area. \newblock (@wang2021survey)

Despite the significant progress made by existing solutions, we argue that current methods fall short in two limitations: (1) Existing social-aware recommendation models only consider collaborative similarity between items, how to incorporate item-wise semantic relatedness is less explored in current recommendation paradigms. (2) Current social recommender systems neglect the entanglement of the latent factors over heterogeneous relations (e.g., social connections, user-item interactions). Learning the disentangled representations with relation heterogeneity poses great challenge for social recommendation. In this work, we design a Disentangled Graph Neural Network (DGNN) with the integration of latent memory units, which empowers DGNN to maintain factorized representations for heterogeneous types of user and item connections. Additionally, we devise new memory-augmented message propagation and aggregation schemes under the graph neural architecture, allowing us to recursively distill semantic relatedness into the representations of users and items in a fully automatic manner. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our model by achieving great improvement over state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

Memorization of feature interactions through a wide set of cross-product feature transformations are effective and interpretable, while generalization requires more feature engineering effort. With less feature engineering, deep neural networks can generalize better to unseen feature combinations through low-dimensional dense embeddings learned for the sparse features. However, deep neural networks with embeddings can over-generalize and recommend less relevant items when the user-item interactions are sparse and high-rank. In this paper, we present Wide \& Deep learning---jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks---to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. We productionized and evaluated the system on Google Play, a commercial mobile app store with over one billion active users and over one million apps. Online experiment results show that Wide \& Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models.

CTR prediction systems are usually based on multi-field categorical features, i.e., every feature is categorical and belongs to one and only one field. Modeling feature conjunctions is crucial for CTR prediction accuracy. However, it requires a massive number of parameters to explicitly model all feature conjunctions, which is not scalable for real-world production systems. In this paper, we describe a novel Field-Leveraged Embedding Network (FLEN) which has been deployed in the commercial recommender system in Meitu and serves the main traffic. FLEN devises a field-wise bi-interaction pooling technique. By suitably exploiting field information, the field-wise bi-interaction pooling captures both inter-field and intra-field feature conjunctions with a small number of model parameters and an acceptable time complexity for industrial applications. We show that a variety of state-of-the-art CTR models can be expressed under this technique. Furthermore, we develop Dicefactor: a dropout technique to prevent independent latent features from co-adapting. Extensive experiments, including offline evaluations and online A/B testing on real production systems, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FLEN against the state-of-the-arts. Notably, FLEN has obtained 5.19\% improvement on CTR with 1/6 of memory usage and computation time, compared to last version (i.e. NFM). \newblock (@chen2019flen)

Localized information, such as neighborhood, is important to recommender systems in complementing the user-item interaction data. Based on this consideration, we propose a novel Neighborhood-based Neural Collaborative Filtering model (NNCF).

The development and implementation of recommender systems that can effectively adapt suggestions to individual user preferences is a key area of research in data mining. Recently, more and more attention has been paid to algorithms that provide more accurate data segmentation to improve the quality of recommendations. In particular, clustering methods allow grouping users based on similar behavioral characteristics, which positively affects the accuracy of the recommendations provided and contributes to their relevance. In the course of this study, modern approaches to the use of clustering methods in the context of creating recommender systems are considered. Considerable attention is paid to the principles of adapting recommendations based on the analysis of user behavior and preferences, as well as the possibilities of improving the accuracy of forecasts through the use of data grouping. Segmentation approaches that allow creating consistent and accurate forecasts for different categories of users, taking into account their unique features and preferences, are considered. The prospects of using different data processing strategies and techniques to improve the quality of recommendations are analyzed. The results of the study emphasize the importance of choosing an appropriate data analysis method to ensure the relevance of the content received by users. It has been determined that effective clustering can significantly improve not only the accuracy of recommendations but also the overall user experience, as it helps to identify hidden patterns in behavior and preferences, which in turn contributes to a deeper understanding of user needs and increases the likelihood of their satisfaction with the service. Thus, this study has significant potential for the development and improvement of recommender systems in various fields. \newblock (@subramaniyaswamy2017adaptive)

Collaborative filtering is a widely adopted approach to recommendation, but sparse data and cold-start users are often barriers to providing high quality recommendations. To address such issues, we propose a novel method that works to improve the performance of collaborative filtering recommendations by integrating sparse rating data given by users and sparse social trust network among these same users. This is a model-based method that adopts matrix factorization technique that maps users into low-dimensional latent feature spaces in terms of their trust relationship, and aims to more accurately reflect the users reciprocal influence on the formation of their own opinions and to learn better preferential patterns of users for high-quality recommendations. We use four large-scale datasets to show that the proposed method performs much better, especially for cold start users, than state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms for social collaborative filtering based on trust. \newblock (@yang2016social)

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings or even none at all. Moreover, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the social interactions or connections among users. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online social networks, social network analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. Following the intuition that a person's social network will affect personal behaviors on the Web, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to solve the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by employing both users' social network information and rating records. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results shows that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few or no ratings. \newblock (@ma2008sorec)

Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user\textasciitilde{}(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13\% performance improvements over the best baselines for top-10 recommendation on the two datasets. \newblock (@wu2019neural)

While many recent efforts show the effectiveness of neural network-based social recommender systems, several important challenges have not been well addressed yet: (i) The majority of models only consider users’ social connections, while ignoring the inter-dependent knowledge across items; (ii) Most of existing solutions are designed for singular type of user-item interactions, making them infeasible to capture the interaction heterogeneity; (iii) The dynamic nature of user-item interactions has been less explored in many social-aware recommendation techniques. To tackle the above challenges, this work proposes a Knowledge-aware Coupled Graph Neural Network (KCGN) that jointly injects the inter-dependent knowledge across items and users into the recommendation framework. KCGN enables the high-order user- and item-wise relation encoding by exploiting the mutual information for global graph structure awareness. Additionally, we further augment KCGN with the capability of capturing dynamic multi-typed user-item interactive patterns.

These advantages of GNNs provide great potential to advance social recommendation since data in social recommender systems can be represented as user-user social graph and user-item graph; and learning latent factors of users and items is the key. However, building social recommender systems based on GNNs faces challenges. For example, the user-item graph encodes both interactions and their associated opinions; social relations have heterogeneous strengths; users involve in two graphs (e.g., the user-user social graph and the user-item graph). To address the three aforementioned challenges simultaneously, in this paper, we present a novel graph neural network framework (GraphRec) for social recommendations. In particular, we provide a principled approach to jointly capture interactions and opinions in the user-item graph and propose the framework GraphRec, which coherently models two graphs and heterogeneous strengths. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework GraphRec. \newblock (@fan2019graph)

However, in social-aware recommendations, there are two issues which influence the inference of users' preferences, and haven't been well-studied in most existing methods: First, the preferences of a user may only partially match that of his friends in certain aspects, especially when considering a user with diverse interests. Second, for an individual, the influence strength of his friends might be different, as not all friends are equally helpful for modeling his preferences in the system. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Social Attentional Memory Network (SAMN) for social-aware recommendation. Specifically, we first design an attention-based memory module to learn user-friend relation vectors, which can capture the varying aspect attentions that a user share with his different friends. Then we build a friend-level attention component to adaptively select informative friends for user modeling. The two components are fused together to mutually enhance each other and lead to a finer extended model. Experimental results on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed SAMN model consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Furthermore, qualitative studies have been made to explore what the proposed attention-based memory module and friend-level attention have learnt, which provide insights into the model's learning process. \newblock (@chen2019social)

Association for Computing Machinery. \newblock \textbf{Abstract:} Effective methodologies for evaluating recommender systems are critical, so that different systems can be compared in a sound manner. A commonly overlooked aspect of evaluating recommender systems is the selection of the data splitting strategy. In this paper, we both show that there is no standard splitting strategy and that the selection of splitting strategy can have a strong impact on the ranking of recommender systems during evaluation. In particular, we perform experiments comparing three common data splitting strategies, examining their impact over seven state-of-the-art recommendation models on two datasets. Our results demonstrate that the splitting strategy employed is an important confounding variable that can markedly alter the ranking of recommender systems, making much of the currently published literature non-comparable, even when the same datasets and metrics are used. \newblock (@meng2020split)

Ask To Rate technique is a simple way to solve this problem. In this technique, some items are shown to the new user, and ask her/him to rate them. Usually, Ask To Rate technique selects the items using kNN algorithm. However, determining k or number of the new user's neighbors in this algorithm is critical, because it affects the accuracy of recommender system. In this paper, a CF based recommender system is improved by Ask To Rate technique to solve cold start problem. Consequently, k or number of the new user's neighbors is determined by an experimental evaluation. The experimental results on MovieLens dataset show that the highest accuracy of recommendations can be seen when the number of neighbors is set by a low value e.g. 10-15 neighbors. \newblock (@bahadorpour2017determining)

Several recent applications need to perform KNN join for high dimensional sparse data. Unfortunately, all existing KNN join algorithms are designed for low dimensional data. To fulfill this void, we investigate the KNN join problem for high dimensional sparse data. In this paper, we propose three KNN join algorithms: a brute force (BF) algorithm, an inverted index-based(IIB) algorithm and an improved inverted index-based(IIIB) algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms for high dimensional sparse data. \newblock (@wang2010efficient)

IEEE, 2020. \newblock \textbf{Abstract:} In recent years, online advertising sales have been the main economic sources of Internet companies such as Google, Facebook, Snap, Pinterest, and Baidu. Advertising click-through rate measures the ratio of users who click an advertisement to the total users who view the advertisement. The click-through rate is very important for Internet companies' online advertisements quality. The click-through rate of online advertising is related to many factors, including gender, age, type of advertisement, and the timely and effective prediction of the click-through rate of online advertising as well as advertisement text. In recent years, the click-through rate of online advertising has become one of the hot areas of research in industry and academia. Advertising prediction models are generally divided into two categories: shallow learning models and deep learning models. This paper surveys Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models, discusses the problems in the current advertising click rate prediction models, and points out future research trends. \newblock (@wang2020survey)

\bibitem{radford2018improving} Alec Radford, Karthik Narasimhan, Tim Salimans, Ilya Sutskever, et~al \newblock Improving language understanding by generative pre-training \newblock 2018. \newblock \textbf{Abstract:} This paper presents a new Unified pre-trained Language Model (UniLM) that can be fine-tuned for both natural language understanding and generation tasks. The model is pre-trained using three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional, bidirectional, and sequence-to-sequence prediction. The unified modeling is achieved by employing a shared Transformer network and utilizing specific self-attention masks to control what context the prediction conditions on. UniLM compares favorably with BERT on the GLUE benchmark, and the SQuAD 2.0 and CoQA question answering tasks. Moreover, UniLM achieves new state-of-the-art results on five natural language generation datasets, including improving the CNN/DailyMail abstractive summarization ROUGE-L to 40.51 (2.04 absolute improvement), the Gigaword abstractive summarization ROUGE-L to 35.75 (0.86 absolute improvement), the CoQA generative question answering F1 score to 82.5 (37.1 absolute improvement), the SQuAD question generation BLEU-4 to 22.12 (3.75 absolute improvement), and the DSTC7 document-grounded dialog response generation NIST-4 to 2.67 (human performance is 2.65).

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data. \newblock (@vaswani2017attention)
